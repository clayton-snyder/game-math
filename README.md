This is a C++ library I wrote to practice expressing core game math ideas in C++ code, particularly Trigonometry and Linear Algebra as they relate to 3D graphics.

It covers basic 3D structures like Vectors, Matrices, Quaternions, Planes, and Lines and includes functions for common operations like calculating dot products and cross products; normalizing and projecting vectors; creating rotation, reflection, scale, and skew matrices; etc. 

All of the code here is written by me, but I relied heavily on the three books listed below to learn the math and used them as references.

## To-do:
* Add unit tests
* Add getRotation around an arbitrary axis
* Add distance functions (point to line, two lines, point to plane)
* Add intersection functions (line + plane, two planes, three planes)
